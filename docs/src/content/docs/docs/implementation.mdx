```

## Technical Perspectives

- **Frontend Framework:** Astro with Starlight template
- **Markdown Processing:** MDX for content creation
- **Version Control** : Git and GitHub
- **CI/CD** : GitHub Actions for automated deployment

### File Structure

This Project is built using Astro Framework with starlight integration So the file structure is Similar to standard Startlight Project

import { FileTree } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

## ADR (Architecture Decision Record)

### ADR-0002: Choosing Deployment Platform

**Status:** Accepted

**Deciders:** [Supakone Kongprapan](https://github.com/preamza02)

**Date:** 2025-11-29

**Technical Story:** [issue-005](https://github.com/preamza02/supakone.me/issues/5)

#### Context and Problem Statement

I need to deploy **Supakone.me** to provide global access to users globally at **0 cost** (except for domain costs) since this is a personal website.

As of today (2025-11-29), **Supakone.me** is an Astro-based website that generates a static site without calling any backend service. So, I think it is possible to host it on a **static hosting platform**.

But at the same time, the **roadmap of Supakone.me** seems to include functionality that might require backend services in the future (e.g., **Contact form**, **Notification system** for new blog posts).

So, when choosing a deployment platform, I need to consider both **static hosting** and the possibility of adding **backend services** in the future.

And since **Supakone.me** is based on a GitHub repository, I want to choose a deployment platform that integrates well with **GitHub** and supports **CI/CD pipelines** easily.

I also have an **n8n service** running on my own server.

**Decision Drivers**

- **Cost:** Free hosting
- **Ease of Deployment:** Simple setup process
- **Support for Static Site Hosting:** Native support for Astro
- **Support for Future Backend Services:** Scalability
- **Performance and Reliability:** Global CDN
- **CI/CD Integration:** Automated workflows
- **Possible Knowledge Gain:** Learning opportunity

**Considered Options**

- **Option 1:** GitHub Pages with Third-Party Backend (e.g., Firebase Functions)
- **Option 2:** AWS S3 + CloudFront with Serverless Backend (e.g., AWS Lambda)
- **Option 3:** GitHub Pages with Serverless Backend (e.g., GCP Cloud Functions, AWS Lambda)
- **Option 4:** Vercel (with Serverless Functions)
- **Option 5:** Cloudflare Pages (with Cloudflare Workers)

#### Decision Outcome

**Chosen Option:** **Option 5: Cloudflare Pages (with Cloudflare Workers)**, utilizing my existing self-hosted n8n for workflow automation (email/notifications).

**The main reason for choosing Cloudflare Pages is:**
It offers the best balance between performance, cost, and developer experience (DX).

1.  **Unified Architecture:** Cloudflare Pages allows for a "monorepo" feel where backend logic (Workers) and frontend code live together. This eliminates CORS issues and simplifies the deployment pipeline compared to separating them (e.g., GitHub Pages + External Backend).
2.  **Hard Cost Cap:** Unlike AWS or Vercel, Cloudflare offers a generous free tier with unlimited bandwidth and requests, ensuring a strictly **$0 cost** for a personal site.
3.  **Future-Proofing:** Since the site is built with Astro, Cloudflare's native adapter support allows me to easily switch from Static Site Generation (SSG) to Server-Side Rendering (SSR) in the future without changing hosting providers.
4.  **Role of n8n:** I will leverage my existing self-hosted n8n instance for "low-code" backend tasks like sending emails or broadcasting notifications, keeping the core application logic clean.
5.  **Cloudflare Workers Serverless Performance:** Cloudflare Workers run on the V8 engine at the edge, providing low-latency responses globally, which is ideal for any future backend needs.

**Positive Consequences**

- **Zero Maintenance:** Native CI/CD integration with GitHub means pushes deploy automatically.
- **Performance:** Content is served from Cloudflare's edge network, which is faster than standard GitHub Pages.
- **Seamless Scaling:** Adding a backend API in the future is as simple as adding a `./functions` directory to the project.

**Negative Consequences**

- **Vendor Lock-in:** Moving away from Cloudflare Workers in the future would require refactoring backend code, as the runtime is specific to Cloudflare (V8 Isolate) rather than standard Node.js containers.

#### Additional Context

**Runner-Up: Option 2 (AWS S3 + CloudFront + Terraform)**
This option was a strong contender because it aligns with my goal of mastering "Hard" engineering concepts and Infrastructure as Code (IaC). However, it was rejected for _this specific project_ (Supakone.me) because the overhead of managing IAM roles and the risk of uncapped billing (DDoS risk) outweighs the benefits for a simple personal blog.

**Note for Future Architecture:**
The AWS + Terraform stack (Option 2) is explicitly reserved for the **FinSim** project, which will require a full-stack environment. This evaluation will serve as a reference for the future FinSim ADR.

### ADR-0001: Choosing Frontend Framework

**Status:** Accepted

**Deciders:** [Supakone Kongprapan](https://github.com/preamza02)

**Date:** 2025-11-24

**Technical Story:** [issue-001](https://github.com/preamza02/supakone.me/issues/1)

#### Context and Problem Statement

When building **Supakone.me**, I needed to choose a frontend framework that would allow me to create a **fast, maintainable, and scalable** personal website.

And also, I want a **feature-rich template document builder** that uses **Markdown-built-in websites** while allowing me to customize it easily.

**Decision Drivers**

- **Markdown Support:** Ease of writing
- **Maintainability:** Long-term project health
- **Static Site Generation:** SEO and Speed
- **Performance:** Load times
- **Community and Ecosystem:** Plugins and support

**Considered Options**

- **Option 1:** Astro with Starlight
- **Option 2:** Hugo
- **Option 3:** Docusaurus.io

#### Decision Outcome

**Chosen Option:** **Astro with Starlight**.

While all options support Markdown and static site generation, **Astro with Starlight** offers the best in terms of **customization** from community plugins and (as I researched) has the **best performance**.

Also, with **Astro's zero-JavaScript principle**, I think this is the best choice for my personal website.
