## ADR (Architecture Decision Record)

### ADR-0001: Choosing Frontend Framework

Status: Accepted

Deciders: [Supakone Kongprapan](https://github.com/preamza02)

Date: 2025-11-24

Technical Story: [issue-001](https://github.com/preamza02/supakone.me/issues/1)

#### Context and Problem Statement
When building Supakone.me, I needed to choose a frontend framework that would allow me to create a fast, maintainable, and scalable personal website.

And also I want a feature-rich template document builder that uses markdown built-in website while allowing me to customize it easily

Decision Drivers
- Markdown Support
- Maintainability
- Static Site Generation
- Performance
- Community and Ecosystem

Considered Options
- Option 1: Astro with Starlight
- Option 2: Hugo
- Option 3: Docusaurus.io 

Decision Outcome

Chosen Option: "Astro with Starlight", while all options support markdown and static site generations, 
Astro with Starlight offers the best in terms of customization from Community plugin and (as I research) have the best performance
also with Astro no javascript principle I think this is the best choice for my personal website.
