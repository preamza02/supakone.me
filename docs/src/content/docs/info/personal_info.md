2. Thailand needs to focus on developing deep tech and high-tech industries.
3. Phrae is a great place because it has "nothing" (that's unique) — making it a perfect place to relax.
4. Learning Chinese and English is essential because they are the languages of the two superpowers.
5. AI-powered startups are the new trend, especially in Thailand where traditional businesses are still dominant.
