Software engineering is my main profession and where I spend most of my working hours.

## Skill set

- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, and ClickHouse.
- **DevOps and cloud:** Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, Tilt, and CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions). Familiar with AWS and GCP.

## Work experience

I have worked in several software engineering roles, mostly focused on backend development.

### Backend Engineer at [API plus tech](https://apiplustech.com)
- **Period**: *Oct 2025 - Present*
- **About Company** : API plus tech is a Thai startup behind the framer killer app [Dicast](https://dicast.io) which is website builder that have build-in Ecommerce feature. Dicast is designed for this specific use-case with CSS style functionality and ease of use. <!-- TODO: Adding Dicast image -->
- **Why I decide to join this Company** : When I was a new graduate,At first like most on my peer I was looking for a big tech company to join. But after I got interview with API plus tech, I was impresses by their technical vision and their culture. They are startup that are tech lead not business lead which is rare to find in Thailand startup scene. They focus on software quality and engineering practices rather than growth hacking and quick money. So I decided to join them as my first full-time job. 
- **What I do**: Worked on developing and maintaining backend services using Node.js and Express.js.
Collaborated with cross-functional teams to design scalable APIs for various applications.

## Projects

I myself like other fellow software engineer we rarely finish our side project and some project is to simple to be consider project but rather a our personal experiment. So I will only list project that I consider worth mentioning here.

### Finsim - Financial Simulator

I build this project to help myself and other people to better understand their personal finance (for free I hope). I will also over engineer this project to be the best software that I can build at that time.

### Supakone.me - Personal Website
- **Description**: This very website that you are reading right now. I built this website to be all-in-one personal website that can serve multiple purpose such as portfolio, blog, documentation site for my open source projects.

- **Source Code**: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/preamza02/supakone.me)

I also document my journey on building this website on [Supakone.me Docs](/docs). So This website is the example of how all-in-one personal website can be done effectively.
